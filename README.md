A portfolio of my work. Features a page with my employment and contact information. This page is then rendered in a few different ways, to show some web technologies. 
Also features a compendium of algorithmic solutions I have come up with. Everything is my personally created work, other than a few helper functions which are commented 
to show where they come from.
