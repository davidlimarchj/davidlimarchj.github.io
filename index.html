    <h1>Welcome to my portfolio page!</h1>
    <!-- Start of discussion of page purpose - dl 6-27-22-->
    <p>My name is David Link, and I am a former software developer, who took some time away to explore a career in law, but is now excited to be getting back to software development. I have three years of experience as a full-stack web developer with Epic Systems in Verona, WI. While on that team, I was our top bug-fixer by volume most months. I also supervised two direct reports during part of my time at Epic, mentored developers who were straight out of school, and supervised a summer intern project. I am comfortable working directly with customers to determine project objectives, as well as internally across teams to ensure collaboration and make use of cross-disciplinary expertise.</p>
    <p>As all of my work was on an internal enterprise system, I do not have any code samples that I can share. This website is intended to help demonstrate my proficiency with software development principles. As a caveat, I will say that my background is not in website development, but instead is in programs that happen to use web technologies. Hopefully, however, this site will show my basic proficiency with some of these technologies, as well as with software development principles in general</p>
    <p>I live in Santa Fe, New Mexico (GMT-6), and am primarily looking for remote work. I am happy to travel as part of my work duties, or for occasional on-site meetings, but I do not anticipate relocating anytime in the near future. I am open to contract or full-time positions. Although I have done remote work as part of my current job, and have had no trouble with asynchronous work, I am also open to synchronous remote work, and can accommodate the company's targeted time zones. I can be contacted at dalink92@proton.me.</p>
    <p><a href="/Link,D Resume.pdf">Here</a> is my resume. I have experience with software development fundamentals, as well as with versioning software such as SVN and Git, and Agile project methodologies. I have professional experience developing in Typescript, C# .Net Core, and Visual Basic 6. I have done personal projects and/or mentored students using Python, SQL, C++, Objective-C, Java, and Scala.</p>
